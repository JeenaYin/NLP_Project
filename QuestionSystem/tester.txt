Fez is an indie puzzle-platform video game developed by Polytron and published by Trapdoor, first released on April 13, 2012, for Xbox Live Arcade. The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world to be one of four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. Designer Phil Fish appeared in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, which detailed Fez's final stages of development and Polytron's related legal issues.
